# Abstract
Imaging diagnostics provides valuable information about the behavior of plasma in various applications, such as tokamak fusion research and space propulsion systems. A tomographic reconstruction is a powerful tool for analyzing imaging diagnostic data and extracting information about plasma shape and position, impurity distribution, and Magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) instabilities. However, the accuracy of the tomographic reconstruction is affected by the imaging diagnostic data. In this study, we propose a deep learning-based approach for reconstructing the 1D profile from synthetic 2D plasma images generated using imaging diagnostics. We first generate synthetic 2D plasma images using a 1D Gaussian profile as input. Then, we use a deep learning architecture to create a 2D Gaussian profile as output, which is used to extract the 1D profile. Our approach offers a more accurate and efficient way to reconstruct the 1D profile from synthetic 2D plasma images, which can improve the accuracy of tomographic reconstruction for plasma imaging diagnostics. The use of deep learning enables robust handling of reconstructing the synthetic imaging data, leading to more reliable and accurate tomographic reconstruction. The proposed method can contribute to the development of advanced plasma technologies and improve our understanding of plasma behavior. Overall, this study presents a novel approach for reconstructing the 1D profile from synthetic 2D plasma images using deep learning-based techniques. The proposed method has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of tomographic reconstruction for plasma imaging diagnostics and contribute to the advancement of plasma technologies.
